            Essential is not really the best mod for many reasons, such as breaking with a lot of mods, being closed source, and shipping an Installer as the mod download. </ProjectParagraph>

            There are many alternatives that can do what essential does, for free, and open source. Some features are exclusive to essential, but people may be working on new alternatives.

            Essential brings the good and bad of bedrock to Java: Easy multiplayer, Group Chat system (Realms Plus), paid cosmetics, and breaking easily.
